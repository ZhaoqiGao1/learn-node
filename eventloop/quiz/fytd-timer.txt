- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

because of the timer baz will be called first
then baz again after that becuase we have a timer zero event  move to call back
they are not waiting because of no i/o thus the next are 2:bar and 1:bar in the executing order.
